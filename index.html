    <p class="welcome">Welcome to the Simulo landing page!</p>
    <p>Simulo is an upcoming 2D physics simulation sandbox app by <a href="https://github.com/Carroted"
            target="_blank">Carroted</a>. It's being written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org"
            target="_blank">Rust</a>, using our <a href="https://discord.gg/Ky7JXDztFM" target="_blank">Lightspeed</a>
        physics engine <span class="emdash">&mdash;</span> a
        port of <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c" target="_blank">Box2D v3</a> to Rust, which we will then
        add <a href="https://google.github.io/liquidfun/" target="_blank">LiquidFun</a> to.</p>

    <div class="project-status">
        <h2>Project Status</h2>
        <span class="status indev">In active development</span>
        <p>We are currently working on the physics engine for Simulo, <a href="https://discord.gg/Ky7JXDztFM"
                target="_blank">Lightspeed</a>. Once it is done, we can make the Simulo runtime and then the game
            itself.</p>
        <span class="estimation-title">Estimated release</span>
        <div class="estimation">Unknown, we are still working on the physics and haven't even started
            on the game yet, so how would we know?</div>
        <p class="join-notice">For real-time updates, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/raceRsDaSX"
                target="_blank">Simulo Discord</a> and the <a href="https://discord.gg/Ky7JXDztFM"

    <p>Throughout its history, Simulo has had 3 rewrites. Here is a table of the Simulos:</p>

            <td><span class="status unsupported">Unsupported</span></td>
            <td>2021</td>
            <td class="long">First version of Simulo, written in <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.
                It was very simple, but was packed with fun
                features like ragdolls, lasers, thrusters, and more.</td>
            <td class="long">Unity was very limiting, and the project would not have been able to develop in the way I
                wanted it to
                with that engine. Thus, I decided to try to rewrite it as a web game.</td>
            <td><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DuwH_vcDOEDn0vwYOhW6YMlDoIJu8-NS?usp=share_link"
                    target="_blank">Try it</a></td>

            <td>Bimulo</td>
            <td><span class="status unsupported">Unsupported</span></td>
            <td>2022</td>
            <td class="long">Second version of Simulo, initially written in JavaScript, but later migrated to
                TypeScript. It was a lot more advanced than
                the Unity version, and introduced many of the features of <a href="http://www.algodoo.com/"
                    target="_blank">Algodoo</a>. This version was exclusively a web
                game, and thus desktop versions would've been <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"
                    target="_blank">Electron</a> apps.</td>
            <td class="long">The codebase was a mess, and the game was slow. I decided to rewrite the engine with what I
                learned from Bimulo.</td>
            <td><a href="https://carroted.github.io/Bimulo/client" target="_blank">Try it</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Simulo NT</td>
            <td><span class="status unsupported">Unsupported</span></td>
            <td>2023</td>
            <td class="long">Third version of Simulo, a rewrite of Bimulo. Simulo NT's custom web engine was a modular
                multiplayer-driven engine with a plugin-based architecture, where every aspect of a game is defined with
                plugins. NT introduced faster physics and rendering, as well as a new UI.</td>
            <td class="long">
                <p>While development was much faster in this engine and the codebase was a pleasure to work
                    with, the game was too stuttery. These random stutters seemed to just be a web limitation that might
                    not
                    be possible to remove. In addition, the new physics engine used (<a href="https://rapier.rs"
                        target="_blank">Rapier</a>) was unstable and crashing
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>Lastly, NT failed to address some of Bimulo's problems, like desktop and mobile versions. As a web
                    game
                    still, desktop versions would've been <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"
                        target="_blank">Electron</a> apps, while people were looking for a desktop app
                    like
                    Algodoo.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons, I decided to rewrite Simulo for the final time, this time
                    in
                    Rust as a native <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a> app.</p>
            </td>
            <td><a href="https://carroted.github.io/Simulo-NT/client" target="_blank">Try it</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Simulo Next</td>
            <td><span class="status indev">In active development</span></td>
            <td>2024+</td>
            <td class="long">
                <p>The final Simulo, in a full Rust rewrite. It will be split into two parts: a Simulo
                    runtime, and a <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a> client.</p>
                <p>The runtime will just
                    be a simple layer over Lightspeed to add save/load,
                    scripting, temperature simulation, electricity, and other features. The client will use the runtime
                    and
                    support desktop, mobile and web. <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a> scripting
                    (specifically <a href="https://luau-lang.org/" target="_blank">Luau</a>) and modding will be
                    supported.
                </p>
            </td>
            <td class="long">
                <p>Simulo Next is currently in development, and with the runtime being separate from the
                    client, there will never be a need to rewrite again.</p>
                <p>Even if I want to switch engines later down the
                    line, it won't affect anything, saves will work the same, and the same game code will be used.</p>
                <p>Simulo
                    Next will be supported for a very long time, and I intend on publishing it to Steam.</p>
