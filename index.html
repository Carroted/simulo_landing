        <p class="welcome">Welcome to the Simulo landing page!</p>
        <p>Simulo is an upcoming 2D physics simulation sandbox by <a href="https://github.com/Carroted"
                target="_blank">Carroted</a>. It's being written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org"
                target="_blank">Rust</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c" target="_blank">Box2D
                v3</a> physics engine. We are also using the <a href="https://bevyengine.org" target="_blank">Bevy game
                engine</a>.

        <div class="project-status">
            <h2>Project Status</h2>
            <span class="status indev">In active development</span>
            <p>Simulo is in a state where we have powerful in-game Lua scripting which we have used to make a platformer
                game, a
                3D renderer, Tetris, etc. We can also use in-game tools to build vehicles, buildings, etc. Development
                is going really well!</p>
            <span class="estimation-title">Estimated release</span>
            <div class="estimation">Probably sometime in 2025</div>

        <p>Throughout its history, Simulo has had 3 rewrites. Here is a table of the Simulos:</p>

                            target="_blank">Unity</a>.
                        It was very simple, but was packed with fun
                        features like ragdolls, lasers, thrusters, and more.</td>
                    <td class="long">Unity was very limiting, and the project would not have been able to develop in the
                        way
                        I
                        wanted it to
                        with that engine. Thus, I decided to try to rewrite it as a web game.</td>

                    <td class="long">Second version of Simulo, initially written in JavaScript, but later migrated to
                        TypeScript. It was a lot more advanced than
                        the Unity version, and introduced many of the features of <a href="http://www.algodoo.com/"
                            target="_blank">Algodoo</a>. This version was exclusively a web
                        game, and thus desktop versions would've been <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"
                            target="_blank">Electron</a> apps.</td>
                    <td class="long">The codebase was a mess, and the game was slow. I decided to rewrite the engine
                        with
                        what I
                        learned from Bimulo.</td>
                    <td><a href="https://carroted.github.io/Bimulo/client" target="_blank">Try it</a></td>

                    <td>2023</td>
                    <td class="long">Third version of Simulo, a rewrite of Bimulo. Simulo NT's custom web engine was a
                        modular
                        multiplayer-driven engine with a plugin-based architecture, where every aspect of a game is
                        defined
                        with
                        plugins. NT introduced faster physics and rendering, as well as a new UI.</td>
                    <td class="long">
                        <p>While development was much faster in this engine and the codebase was a pleasure to work
                            with, the game was too stuttery. These random stutters seemed to just be a web limitation
                            that
                            might
                            not
                            be possible to remove. In addition, the new physics engine used (<a href="https://rapier.rs"
                                target="_blank">Rapier</a>) was unstable and crashing
                            frequently.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, NT failed to address some of Bimulo's problems, like desktop and mobile versions. As
                            a
                            web
                            game
                            still, desktop versions would've been <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/"
                                target="_blank">Electron</a> apps, while people were looking for a desktop app
                            like
                            Algodoo.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, I decided to rewrite Simulo for the final time, this time
                            in
                            Rust as a native <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a> app.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td><a href="https://carroted.github.io/Simulo-NT/client" target="_blank">Try it</a></td>

                    <td class="long">
                        <p>The final Simulo, in a full Rust rewrite. It is split into two parts: a Simulo
                            runtime, and a <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a> client.</p>
                        <p>The runtime is just
                            a layer over Box2D to add save/load,
                            Lua scripting, etc. The client will use the
                            runtime
                            and
                            support desktop, and later mobile.

                    <td class="long">
                        <p>Simulo Next is currently in development, and with the runtime being separate from the
                            client, there will never be a need to rewrite again.</p>
                        <p>Simulo
                            Next will be supported for a very long time, and I intend on publishing it to Steam.</p>
